# Flutter Plugin

> **Advanced usage** — the Flutter plugin wraps the iOS and Android native
> bindings behind a Dart method-channel API. It requires native artifacts to
> be built first and is intended for teams already using Flutter. If you only
> target Android or iOS natively, use the dedicated platform binding instead.

```

## Dart API

```dart
import 'package:unfydqry/unfydqry.dart';

// Open an engine (creates or opens the SQLite file at dbPath)
final engine = await SearchEngine.open(dbPath);

// Index a document
await engine.index(1, 'Ｐｙｔｈｏｮ 入門');

// Search — returns list sorted by BM25 score
final hits = await engine.search('python');     // → [Hit(id: 1, score: -1.521)]
final paged = await engine.search('tokyo', limit: 10);

// Remove a document
await engine.remove(1);

// Release native resources
await engine.dispose();
```

`Hit.id` is the same stable identifier passed to `index`. Re-fetch the full
record from your source-of-truth store.

## Method channel

Channel name: **`unfydqry/search`**

| Method | Arguments | Return |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | `dbPath: String` | `int` handle |
| `index` | `handle: int, id: int, text: String` | — |
| `remove` | `handle: int, id: int` | — |
| `search` | `handle: int, query: String, limit: int` | `List<Map<String, dynamic>>` |
| `dispose` | `handle: int` | — |

Engines are identified by an integer handle so multiple instances can coexist.

Both platforms return the same `FlutterError` codes so Dart sees identical
failures regardless of host OS:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BAD_ARGS` | A required argument was missing or the wrong type |
| `NO_ENGINE` | The `handle` does not refer to an open engine |
| `SEARCH_ERROR` | The native engine raised a `SearchError`/`SearchException` |
| `PLUGIN_ERROR` | Any other unexpected native failure |

## Native-binding dependency

Both platform implementations import the native binding class directly:

| Platform | Import |
|---|---|
| iOS (`UnfydqryPlugin.swift`) | `import UnifiedQuery` → `SearchEngine` |
| Android (`UnfydqryPlugin.kt`) | `import uniffi.unfydqry.SearchEngine` |

If the binding API changes the plugin fails to compile — drift is caught at
build time, not at runtime.

## Native-artifact packaging

How the prebuilt native binaries reach a consuming app.

**Current — strategy A (copy into the plugin):**
The XCFramework is built at `<repo>/ios/UnifiedQuery.xcframework` and copied
into the pod root `flutter/ios/`, where the podspec vendors it by bare name
(`s.vendored_frameworks = 'UnifiedQuery.xcframework'`). The copy is gitignored.
This keeps the pod self-contained (so `pod lib lint` passes) without committing
binaries. Android mirrors this by reading the prebuilt `.so` files.

Trade-off: every consumer must build the Rust core locally first.

**Planned — strategy C (download a release binary):**
Once tagged releases exist, fetch a prebuilt artifact at `pod install` time so
plugin consumers no longer need the Rust toolchain:

```ruby
s.source = { :http => 'https://github.com/0x0c/unfydqry/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/UnifiedQuery.xcframework.zip' }
```

with the Android side switching to a published Maven artifact carrying the
`.so` files. This is deferred until a release/versioning cadence is in place;
the migration point is flagged in `flutter/ios/unfydqry.podspec`.

## Build prerequisites

- Flutter SDK ≥ 3.10
- Rust stable (rustup)
- macOS + Xcode 26+ (iOS side)
- Android NDK r29+ and Android SDK (Android side)
- The XCFramework and `.so` native artifacts must be built before running

## Building native artifacts

**iOS XCFramework**:

The canonical artifact is `<repo>/ios/UnifiedQuery.xcframework` — the same one
the native iOS binding ships. The assembly steps live in
[`.github/workflows/swift-tests.yml`](../.github/workflows/swift-tests.yml)
(the "Assemble … XCFramework" step); reproduced here for a single macOS slice:

```sh
cd core
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin

# Stage the C header + modulemap the xcframework needs.
mkdir -p ../ios/build/xc/macos/headers
cp generated/swift/unfydqryFFI.h ../ios/build/xc/macos/headers/
cat > ../ios/build/xc/macos/headers/module.modulemap <<'EOF'
module unfydqryFFI {
    header "unfydqryFFI.h"
    export *
}
EOF
cp target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/libunfydqry.a ../ios/build/xc/macos/libunfydqry.a

cd ..
rm -rf ios/UnifiedQuery.xcframework
xcodebuild -create-xcframework \
  -library ios/build/xc/macos/libunfydqry.a \
  -headers ios/build/xc/macos/headers \
  -output ios/UnifiedQuery.xcframework
```

For a shippable framework, repeat the Rust build + `-library`/`-headers` pair
for each device/simulator target (`aarch64-apple-ios`,
`aarch64-apple-ios-sim`, `x86_64-apple-ios`) and pass them all to a single
`-create-xcframework` invocation.

Finally, copy the result into the plugin's pod root so CocoaPods can vendor it
(see "Native-artifact packaging" below):

```sh
cp -R ios/UnifiedQuery.xcframework flutter/ios/UnifiedQuery.xcframework
```

**Android `.so` files**:

```sh
cd core
ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/ndk cargo ndk \
  -t arm64-v8a -t armeabi-v7a -t x86_64 \
  -o ../android/jniLibs build --release
```

## Tests and sample

```sh
# Dart unit tests (mock method channel, no native artifacts required)
cd flutter
flutter test                     # 13 cases

# Sample app (native artifacts must be built first)
cd flutter/example
flutter run
```
